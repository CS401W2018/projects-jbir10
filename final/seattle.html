            <h2>About Seattle</h2>
            <p>Seattle is a city in the state of Washington. It is located in the Pacific Northwest, surrounded by water, mountains, and green trees. The weather is mild with lots of rain, giving it a cozy feel. The city has a mix of technology, art, and great coffee spots. You can enjoy fresh seafood, clam chowder, and salmon but I'm not the biggest fan of seafood. You can visit the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, or take a ferry ride. For outdoor fun activities one can explore trails, lakes, or Mount Rainier nearby.</p>

            <h3>My top 3 things to do in Seattle</h3>
            <p>There's a lot of things to do in Seattle, some of them are recommended in specific weather. I have been lucky to visit seattle in summer and winter season. During summer is quite hot but it's always good to see the sun and see the colorful city. While in winter, it's cold and grey outside which makes it the perfect time to go around the city or try new food places. Anyways my three favourite things to do in Seattle is hiking, cruising around the city, and trying out new foods.</p>
