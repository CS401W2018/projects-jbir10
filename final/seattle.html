            <h2>About Seattle</h2>
            <p>Hawaii is a beautiful island with a tropical climate-all year warm yet with light showers occasionaly to provide some moderation to the heat. The island is rich with culture, blending ancient traditions with modern influences. A culinary experience that can't be missed features dishes such as poke, Huli Huli Chicken, and Malasadas. Throughout one's stay, one easily passes from gorgeous beaches to historic sites, such as Pearl Harbor, lookouts on hiking trails, and immersion into local life in Honolulu. For either recreation or action, there is something for just about everybody.</p>
