            <h3>My top 3 things to do in Seattle</h3>
            <p>There's a lot of things to do in Seattle, some of them are recommended in specific weather. I have been lucky to visit seattle in summer and winter season. During summer is quite hot but it's always good to see the sun and see the colorful city. While in winter, it's cold and grey outside which makes it the perfect time to go around the city or try new food places. Anyways my three favourite things to do in Seattle is hiking, cruising around the city, and trying out new foods.</p>
