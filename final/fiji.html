            <h2>About Fiji</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in the Island of Fiji. Fiji is known for it's vibrant sunshine, transparent sea waters, and luxuriant foliage, and it lies nestled in the South Pacific Ocean. With a heavily relied on tradition, it gives huge cognizance to its community feeling. Traditional Fijian food is rich with flavors, the best dishes are kokoda(Raw Fish), lovo(earth-oven cooked food), seafood, and coconut milk, among others. The visitors are treated to unspoiled beaches, colorful coral reefs, hiking in lush rainforests, and visiting local villages. For adventure or relaxation, Fiji is a once in a lifetime island experience. </p>
