            <h2>About Fiji</h2>
            <p>Fiji has a warm, sub-tropical climate with two seasons: summer (wet season) from November to April and winter (dry season) from May to October. Summer is hot and humid, with temperatures around 25-31°C, occasional rain, and colorful sunsets, while winter is cooler, with temperatures ranging from 19-28°C and less rainfall. The larger islands offer diverse weather, from lush rainforests in the east to dry forests in the west. You can enjoy swimming in warm waters year-round, visit beautiful beaches, try out new foods, and take in mesmerizing views.<br>
