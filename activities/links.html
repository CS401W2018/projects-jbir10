        <h1>Html Links</h1>
        
        <p>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.<br>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/feature/general-conference?lang=eng">Watch General Conference</a></p>

        <p>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?<br>
        Absolute link has entire url, while a relative url is shorter and links to a path in the current directory. Relavtive links are faster to use.</p>

        <p>Link to another engagement assignment (something in an activity folder).<br>
            first.html on nav section. 
        </p>

        <p>List the 3 rules with relative links.<br>
        the period . means the current folder(not used)<br>
        2 periods .. means parent folder<br>
        slash      / means start of the root

        </p>
        <p>Link to your last project.<br>
            Profile page on nav section. 
        </p>
        <p>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?<br>
        No, not really. </p>
