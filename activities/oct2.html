        GIF works well for simple images with few colors or animations.</p>
        <p>What is unique about the PNG format?<br>
        PNG is unique because it supports transparent backgrounds and lossless compression.</p>
        <p>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?<br>
        To resize your photo to the correct size, use photo editing software to adjust its dimensions.</p>
        <p>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?
        Resizing photos with editing software is better because it keeps quality, while resizing with CSS can make them blurry or stretched.</p>
