    <h1>Jasveen Bir</h1>
    <p><strong><em>Hello &amp; Welcome to my profile page. </em></strong><br>
        <br>
    I was born in the  <strong>Island of Fiji</strong> which is around 3500 miles southwest of Laie Hawaii.<br>
    This is my junior year here at BYUH.<br>
    I am a <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> major student here.
    </p>

    <p>In my spare time I like to play video games, go hiking, and working out at the gym,<br>
       I also love cooking occassionaly, trying out new foods and travelling. I have<br>
       travelled to places like Auckland-New Zealand, Salt Lake City-Utah, Seattle-Washington <br>
       San Francisco-California, Los Angeles-California, and Las Vegas-Nevada. <br>
       As for Hiking, I haven't done much hiking here in Hawaii, but i have been to a few places<br>
       like, Koko head, Mt Haleakala in Maui, Chinaman's Hat(also had to kayak to the little island),<br>
       also Mt Rainier in Seattle. As for my favorite games, they include Fifa, Call of Duty, Pubg, <br>
       Need for Speed,Tekken and God of War.<br>
       <br>
       However, if i was to rank what my top 3 hobbies were, they would be as follows:
